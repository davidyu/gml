# gml

Strongly opinionated personal math library ported across several languages I use most often for game and graphics prototyping:

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/davidyu/gml-ts) ([docs](http://davidyu.github.io/gml/doc/ts/))
- [Haxe](https://github.com/davidyu/gml-hx) ([docs](http://davidyu.github.io/gml/doc/hx/))
- [C++](https://github.com/davidyu/gml-cpp) (no docs yet)

Most of this library is still under heavy development and therefore the API is highly unstable (and not production-ready).
